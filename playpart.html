    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>Thanks; put it on the table.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>_[doing so]_.</p>
    <p>But it is very much in want of mending.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.</p>

    <h4>NORA.</h4>
    <p>Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.</p>

    <h4>NURSE.</h4>
    <p>What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
    and make yourself ill.</p>
