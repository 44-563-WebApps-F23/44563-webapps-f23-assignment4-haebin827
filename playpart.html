    <b>NURSE.</b><br>
    At last I have found the box with the fancy dress.<br><br>

    <b>NORA.</b><br>
    Thanks; put it on the table.<br><br>

    <b>NURSE.</b><br>
    <p>_[doing so]_.</p> But it is very much in want of mending.<br><br>

    <b>NORA.</b><br>
    I should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces.<br><br>

    <b>NURSE.</b><br>
    What an idea! It can easily be put in order—just a little patience.<br><br>

    <b>NORA.</b><br>
    Yes, I will go and get Mrs Linde to come and help me with it.<br><br>

    <b>NURSE.</b><br>
    What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
    and make yourself ill.<br><br>
